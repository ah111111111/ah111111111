          <h5>London, UK  (2010-2014)</h5>
          <p>
            The curved form of this 160m commercial tower, designed by Rafael Vinoly Architects, tapers elegantly

            outward from a small footprint. Above the office floor is a spectacular public SkyGarden offering

            panoramic views to the north over the city of London and to south over the Thames. The enclosure for

            the SkyGarden series of doubly-curved steel portal frames which span the full distance of the floor plate

            and are a continuation of the building’s signature fin expression. Glass panels enclose the zones

            between the portals and a 15m tall curved glass walls at the north and south ends are suspended from

            the roof portals above.*

            square meter column-free area, the steel roof structure supports translucent glass on the exterior and

            interior surfaces. The design intent from architect Charles Correa was to create a glowing crystalline

            volume which could be experienced from both the exterior and interior of the facility.*

          <h3>Project Engineer and Lead Modeler – Feature Elements, Art Gallery of Ontario Stage III Expansion</h3>
          <h5>Toronto, Canada (2004-2009)</h5>
          <p>
            Stage III, the Gallery's expansion and renovation project, was the final phase of a 3 phase expansion

            program that was planned in the mid-1960s. Stage III is architecturally-sensitive to its traditional

            surroundings, and successfully integrates all the original designs of the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO),

            which spans some 175 years, and incorporates Georgian Beaux-Arts and Modernist styles.  This

            extension of the existing AGO facilities and addition includes a new gallery, administrative, storage

            vaults, prints, feature stair, and drawings centre. The space proportion and scale of the rooms provide

            for flexibility within the spaces to allow for adjustments over time and changes in the collections. A 12m

            high interior court permitting sculpture exhibition, concerts, openings and special events was added, as

            was a 6m by 18m cantilevered entrance canopy. A double tier of gallery shops having street access

            provides vitality and commercial activity. A continuous glass canopy provides covered access into the

            shops and directs visitors to the main entrance.*
